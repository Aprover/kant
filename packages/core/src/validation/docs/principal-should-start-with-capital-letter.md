# principalShoudlStartWithCapitalLetter Validation Function Documentation

The `principalShoudlStartWithCapitalLetter` function is a custom validation function that checks `Protocol` language models to ensure that all principal names start with a capital letter. If a principal's name does not start with a capital letter, the function issues a warning.

## Function Signature

```typescript
principalShoudlStartWithCapitalLetter: (protocol: Protocol, accept: ValidationAcceptor): MaybePromise<void>
```

This function takes two arguments:

- `protocol`: An instance of the `Protocol` language model, which represents the complete abstract syntax tree (AST) of the parsed source code.
- `accept`: A `ValidationAcceptor` instance used to report errors, warnings, or info messages about the validation.

## Function Description

1. The function iterates over all `Principal` nodes in the protocol.
2. For each `Principal` node, it checks the first character of the principal's name and transforms it into uppercase.
3. If the first character of the principal's name is not the same as the uppercase version, it issues a warning message, indicating that the principal name should start with a capital letter.

## Usage

The `principalShoudlStartWithCapitalLetter` function enforces a naming convention where all principal definitions should start with an uppercase letter. By incorporating this function into Kant's validation service, it can maintain a consistent naming style.
