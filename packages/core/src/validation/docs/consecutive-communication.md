# consecutiveCommunications Validation Function Documentation

`consecutiveCommunications` is a custom validation function that checks for consecutive communication statements in a `Protocol` language model that are identical. If such redundant communications are found, the function issues a warning.

## Function Signature

```typescript
consecutiveCommunications: (protocol: Protocol, accept: ValidationAcceptor): MaybePromise<void>
```

This function receives two arguments:

- `protocol`: An instance of the `Protocol` language model, representing the complete abstract syntax tree (AST) of the parsed source code.
- `accept`: A `ValidationAcceptor` instance that's used to report errors, warnings, or information regarding the validation.

## Function Description

1. The function initializes an empty array `communications`, meant to store all communication instances (`Communication` nodes) in the protocol.

2. It then iterates over all nodes in the `Protocol` AST, collecting all `Communication` nodes into the `communications` array.

3. Afterwards, the function iterates through each `Communication` node in the array, comparing it with the next `Communication` node (if present). It does this by converting the `Communication` nodes into string format using the `communicationToString` helper function.

4. If the string representations of two consecutive `Communication` nodes are identical, a warning is issued through the `accept` method, indicating a redundant consecutive communication.

### Helper Function: `communicationToString`

This function converts a `Communication` node into a string representation. It does this by concatenating the sender's name, the receivers' names, and the knowledge reference names, separated by commas.

## Usage

The `consecutiveCommunications` function can be used as part of the validation suite in Kant to ensure the reduction of redundant communication statements. By integrating it into the validation service, you will receive warnings about consecutive identical communication statements, which can help you improve the efficiency and readability.
