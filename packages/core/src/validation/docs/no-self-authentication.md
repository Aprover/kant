# noSelfAuthentication Validation Function Documentation

The `noSelfAuthentication` function is a custom validation function designed to validate `Protocol` language models by ensuring that no principal in the system is allowed to authenticate themselves. If such a case is detected, an error is raised.

## Function Signature

```typescript
noSelfAuthentication: (protocol: Protocol, accept: ValidationAcceptor): MaybePromise<void>
```

This function takes two arguments:

- `protocol`: An instance of the `Protocol` language model, representing the complete abstract syntax tree (AST) of the parsed source code.
- `accept`: A `ValidationAcceptor` instance used to report errors, warnings, or info messages about the validation.

## Function Description

1. The function starts by streaming all contents of the provided protocol.

2. It then filters the stream to include only nodes representing authentication checks (`isAuthenticationCheck`).

3. For each of the resulting nodes, it checks whether the principal attempting the authentication is the same as the target principal being authenticated.

4. If it is found that a principal is trying to authenticate themselves, the function reports an error using the `accept` function.

## Usage

By using this function in the validation service suite, you can help to prevent users from making this mistake in their code.
