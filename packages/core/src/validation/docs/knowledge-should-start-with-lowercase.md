# knowledgeShouldStartWithLowelcase Validation Function Documentation

The `knowledgeShouldStartWithLowelcase` function is a custom validation function that checks if the names of knowledge definitions in a `Protocol` language model start with a lowercase letter. If a knowledge name does not start with a lowercase letter, the function reports a warning.

## Function Signature

```typescript
knowledgeShouldStartWithLowelcase: (protocol: Protocol, accept: ValidationAcceptor): MaybePromise<void>
```

This function takes two arguments:

- `protocol`: An instance of the `Protocol` language model, representing the complete abstract syntax tree (AST) of the parsed source code.
- `accept`: A `ValidationAcceptor` instance used to report errors, warnings, or info messages about the validation.

## Function Description

1. The function iterates over all the knowledge definitions built into the protocol. For each knowledge definition, it checks if the first character of the name is lowercase. If not, it reports a warning using the `accept` function.

2. It repeats the above step for custom knowledge definitions.

3. It also checks if the knowledge definitions set in a destructuring assignment start with a lowercase letter. If not, it reports a warning.

## Usage

The `knowledgeShouldStartWithLowelcase` function enforces a naming convention where all knowledge definitions should start with a lowercase letter. By incorporating this function into Kant's validation service, it can maintain a consistent naming style.
