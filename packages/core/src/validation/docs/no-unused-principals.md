# noUnusedPrincipals Validation Function Documentation

The `noUnusedPrincipals` function is a custom validation function that checks `Protocol` language models to ensure that every principal declared is used within the model. If a principal is declared but never used, the function issues a warning.

## Function Signature

```typescript
noUnusedPrincipals: (protocol: Protocol, accept: ValidationAcceptor): MaybePromise<void>
```

This function takes two arguments:

- `protocol`: An instance of the `Protocol` language model, which represents the complete abstract syntax tree (AST) of the parsed source code.
- `accept`: A `ValidationAcceptor` instance used to report errors, warnings, or info messages about the validation.

## Function Description

1. The function creates two `Set` instances: `principals` and `references` to store the declared principals and their usages, respectively.

2. It iterates through all `Principal` nodes in the protocol, adding each principal's name to the `principals` set.

3. Next, it iterates through all `Communication`, `AuthenticationCheck`, `KnowledgeCheck`, and `PrincipalKnowledgeDef` nodes in the protocol, adding any referenced principals to the `references` set.

4. Finally, the function iterates over the `principals` set, and if any principal is not found in the `references` set, it issues a warning that the principal is declared but never used.

## Usage

The `noUnusedPrincipals` function helps identify any unused declarations and encourage the clean-up of unused code, thus enhancing readability and maintainability.
