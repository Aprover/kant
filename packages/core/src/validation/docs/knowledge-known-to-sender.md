# knowledgeKnownToSender Validation Function Documentation

The `knowledgeKnownToSender` function is a custom validation function that checks if the knowledge communicated in a `Communication` node of a `Protocol` language model is known to the sender. If a sender communicates a piece of knowledge it does not possess, the function reports an error.

## Function Signature

```typescript
knowledgeKnownToSender: (protocol: Protocol, accept: ValidationAcceptor): MaybePromise<void>
```

This function takes two arguments:

- `protocol`: An instance of the `Protocol` language model, representing the complete abstract syntax tree (AST) of the parsed source code.
- `accept`: A `ValidationAcceptor` instance used to report errors, warnings, or info messages about the validation.

## Function Description

1. The function creates a Map `km` where each principal's name is a key to a list of knowledge it possesses.

2. It initializes the `km` Map with each principal having an empty set of knowledge.

3. The function then seeks out top-level shared knowledge definitions and adds them to each principal's knowledge set.

4. It then processes each principal's specific knowledge definitions and adds them to their knowledge set.

5. Once all the knowledge has been processed and added to the `km` Map, it goes through each `Communication` node.

6. It checks if the sender of each communication has the knowledge that they are communicating. If not, an error is reported.

7. Lastly, the function adds the communicated knowledge to the knowledge set of each recipient.

## Usage

The `knowledgeKnownToSender` function ensures that each sender in a `Protocol` language model only communicates knowledge that it possesses. By incorporating this function into the validation service, you can enforce the correct usage of communication within the protocol specification, ensuring that knowledge only flows from those who possess it.
