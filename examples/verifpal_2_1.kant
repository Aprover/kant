principal Alice, Bob

Alice know {
	fresh a,
	ga = PUB_GEN(a)
}

Alice -> Bob : ga

Bob know {
	fresh b,
	gb = PUB_GEN(b),
	fresh m1,
	ss_a = DF(ga, b),
	e1 = AEAD_ENC(m1) with { k=ss_a, auth=gb }
}

check here Bob should know m1
check here Alice should not know m1

Bob -> Alice : [ gb, e1 ]

Alice know {
	ss_b = DF(gb, a),
	AEAD_DEC(e1) with { k=ss_b, auth=gb }
}

check here only Bob, Alice should know m1
check Alice should authenticate Bob with e1
check ss_a, ss_b should be equal
